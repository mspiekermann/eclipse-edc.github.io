title: PR Check List
weight: 40
---

It's recommended to submit a draft pull request early on and add people previously working on the same code as
reviewers. Make sure all automatic checks pass before marking it as "ready for review":

Before submitting a PR, please follow the steps below.

### Open a Discussion or File an Issue

Do not submit a PR without first opening an issue (if the PR resolves a bug) or creating a discussion. If a bug fix
requires a significant change or touches on critical code paths (e.g. security-related), open a discussion first.

### Coding Style

All code contributions must strictly adhere to the [Style Guide](styleguide.md) and design principles outlined in the
Contributor Technical Documentation. **PRs that do not adhere to these rules will be rejected.**

All artifacts must include the following copyright header, replacing the fields enclosed by curly brackets "{}" with
your own identifying information. (Don't include the curly brackets!) Enclose the text in the appropriate comment syntax
for the file format.

```text
Copyright (c) {year} {owner}[ and others]

### Commit Messages

Git commit messages should comply with the following format:

```
<prefix>(<scope>): <description>
```

Use the [imperative mood](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches)
as in "Fix bug" or "Add feature" rather than "Fixed bug" or "Added feature" and
[mention the GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
e.g. `chore(transfer process): improve logging`.

All committers and all commits, are bound to
the [Developer Certificate of Origin.](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/DCO.php)
As such, all parties involved in a contribution must have valid ECAs. Additionally, commits can
include a ["Signed-off-by" entry](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Contributing_via_Git).

### Testing and Documentation

All submissions must include extensive test coverage and be fully documented:

* Add meaningful unit tests and integration tests when appropriate to verify your submission acts as expected.
* All code must be documented. Interfaces and implementation classes must have Javadoc. Include inline documentation
  where code blocks are not self-explanatory.
* If a new module has been added or a significant part of the code has been changed, and you should be seen as the
  contact person for any further changes, please add appropriate
  information to the [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/blob/main/CODEOWNERS)
  file. You can find instructions on how to do this at <https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/>.
  Please note that this file does not represent all contributions to the code. What persons and organizations
  actually contributed to each file can be seen on GitHub and is documented in the license headers.
